  abstract = {\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Since 2011, the SOPHIE spectrograph has been used to search for Neptunes and super-Earths in the northern hemisphere. As part of this observational program, 290 radial velocity measurements of the 6.4 \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$} magnitude star HD 158259 were obtained. Additionally, TESS photometric measurements of this target are available. We present an analysis of the SOPHIE data and compare our results with the output of the TESS pipeline.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The radial velocity data, ancillary spectroscopic indices, and ground-based photometric measurements were analyzed with classical and {$\mathscr{l}$}\textsubscript{1{$<$}sub/{$>$} periodograms. The stellar activity was modeled as a correlated Gaussian noise and its impact on the planet detection was measured with a new technique.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} The SOPHIE data support the detection of five planets, each with \emph{m{$<$}i/{$>$} sin \emph{i{$<$}i/{$>$} {$\approx$} 6 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}, orbiting HD 158259 in 3.4, 5.2, 7.9, 12, and 17.4 days. Though a planetary origin is strongly favored, the 17.4 d signal is classified as a planet candidate due to a slightly lower statistical significance and to its proximity to the expected stellar rotation period. The data also present low frequency variations, most likely originating from a magnetic cycle and instrument systematics. Furthermore, the TESS pipeline reports a significant signal at 2.17 days corresponding to a planet of radius {$\approx$}1.2 \emph{R{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$}. A compatible signal is seen in the radial velocities, which confirms the detection of an additional planet and yields a {$\approx$}2 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus<$}sub/{$>$} mass estimate.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find a system of five planets and a strong candidate near a 3:2 mean motion resonance chain orbiting HD 158259. The planets are found to be outside of the two and three body resonances.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {This paper concerns a class of group-lasso learning problems where the objective function is the sum of an empirical loss and the group-lasso penalty. For a class of loss function satisfying a quadratic majorization condition, we derive a unified algorithm called groupwise-majorization-descent (GMD) for efficiently computing the solution paths of the corresponding group-lasso penalized learning problem. GMD allows for general design matrices, without requiring the predictors to be group-wise orthonormal. As illustration examples, we develop concrete algorithms for solving the group-lasso penalized least squares and several group-lasso penalized large margin classifiers. These group-lasso models have been implemented in an R package gglasso publicly available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gglasso. On simulated and real data, gglasso consistently outperforms the existing software for computing the group-lasso that implements either the classical groupwise descent algorithm or Nesterov's method.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for analysing radial velocity data that combines two features: all the planets are searched at once and the algorithm is fast. This is achieved by utilizing compressed sensing techniques, which are modified to be compatible with the Gaussian process framework. The resulting tool can be used like a Lomb\textendash Scargle periodogram and has the same aspect but with much fewer peaks due to aliasing. The method is applied to five systems with published radial velocity data sets: HD 69830, HD 10180, 55 Cnc, GJ 876 and a simulated very active star. The results are fully compatible with previous analysis, though obtained more straightforwardly. We further show that 55 Cnc e and f could have been respectively detected and suspected in early measurements from the Lick Observatory and Hobby\textendash Eberly Telescope available in 2004, and that frequencies due to dynamical interactions in GJ 876 can be seen.}

  abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},
